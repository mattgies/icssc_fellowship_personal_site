                Hi! I'm Matt

        <p style="color: white; font-family: Karla; font-size: x-large;">
            Hi! I'm Mattâ€”a designer, artist, and video game enthusiast from California.
            I am currently in my third year of Computer Science at UC Irvine, but the SF Bay Area has been my home for over a decade.
        </p>
        <p style="color: white; font-family: Karla; font-size: x-large;">
            I thrive at the intersection between technology and art.
            I have found so much joy in leveraging technology to express myself and connect with others. My history with art and design throughout high school and college has given me a unique creative approach to technology. I find that my strength in visual analysis helps me better understand the technological systems I am curious about, and my technical focus has given my art a more cohesive and message-driven quality.
        </p>
        <p style="color: white; font-family: Karla; font-size: x-large;">
            I'm passionate about telling stories.
            I am fascinated by others' experiences and want to share their unique perspectives with the world. My favorite video games are narrative-driven, and I love to engross myself in the lore of other worlds. I am eager for the opportunity to travel and immerse myself in other cultures.
        </p>
